# cl-abc: ABC Notation for Common Lisp

This is a library intended to provide a CLOS-based API for parsing,
manipulating, and producing ABC music files.  

It's being written because it's needed for a research problem. Therefore speed
of development is being heavily favored over correctnes--it just needs to work
for the subset of ABC that I'm dealing with. I might refactor it heavily myself
in the future. Contributions are welcome at any time.
